# Sudoku
Simple, basic sudoku thing.

Boards generated with: https://kjell.haxx.se/sudoku/


Things that can be improved:
* Combine the checks so that it only checks a cell one time and not many times
* Cleanup
* Implement a solver that can solve any sudoku
* Implement a generator for new boards based on difficulty, like the one used to generate the boards that are there now
